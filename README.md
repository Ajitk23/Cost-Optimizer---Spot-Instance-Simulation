# Cost-Optimizer---Spot-Instance-Simulation
I am building a Databricks-based simulation tool that demonstrates the cost savings when using spot instances compared to on-demand instances for Spark jobs. This project teaches cost optimization principles for cloud data processing, which is a critical skill for modern data engineers and analysts.
