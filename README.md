# Cost-Optimizer : Spot-Instance-Simulation
I am building a Databricks-based simulation tool that demonstrates the cost savings when using spot instances compared to on-demand instances for Spark jobs. This project teaches cost optimization principles for cloud data processing, which is a critical skill for modern data engineers and analysts.

ðŸ“Œ In simple terms:
**Companies run big data jobs (e.g., Spark jobs for data processing).

Cloud providers charge differently for on-demand instances (always available) vs spot instances (cheaper but can be interrupted anytime).**
The Cost Optimizer Notebook lets a user:
  
  Pick job type (e.g., word count, data aggregation)
  
  Pick data size, instance type, job duration
  
  Simulate how much that job would cost on on-demand vs spot instances
  
  See the cost difference visualized as a chart

This helps people understand cost savings and make better cloud decisions.
